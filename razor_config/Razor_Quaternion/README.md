Razor 9-DOF IMU AHRS Quaternion Code Demo
-----------------------------------------
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e__7bpqa8sE

This video is a walk through of the Sparkfun 9-DOF Razor IMU AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference System) with Quaternion propagation implemented.

The provided AHRS code through Sparkfun uses a DCM (Direction Cosine Matrix) propagation algorithm, which was used as a base to implement the quaternion propagation instead of the DCM propagation.
